## What is Fair Dating about?
Fair Dating is a pro consumer initiative advocating for equal opportunity, transparency and fairness in **online dating platforms**.

Our position is grounded in established research from **human–computer interaction (HCI)**, **behavioral economics** and **consumer protection law**, which shows that many digital platforms employ so called **dark pattern** design and monetization mechanisms that deliberately manipulate user behavior in ways users would not otherwise choose.

We oppose business models that manufacture frustration, artificial scarcity, and emotional pressure in order to monetize social vulnerability.  
Our focus lies exclusively on online dating services that mediate social participation through opaque algorithms and manipulative monetization mechanics.

Our mission is to support and help shape legislation that enforces transparency, limits exploitative design and prohibits monetization strategies that prey on users need for social connection and belonging in spaces where users are at their most vulnerable.

We oppose **predatory platform design** that restricts visibility, opportunity and social participation behind a paywall.

## What we take issue with

Research in HCI and digital consumer protection has repeatedly documented the use of dark patterns and exploitative designs across digital products, including social and matchmaking platforms.  
These patterns are well known and regulated, restricted or in the process of being restricted in adjacent domains such as gambling, gaming, and financial services.

Many dating service platforms make liberal use of these deliberate design decisions to coax users into paid subscription premium options or to purchase short term benefits such as boosts. 

In specific terms:
### Opaque algorithms
The vast majority of large-scale dating platforms rely on algorithmic systems to create and/or facilitate matches between users of the platform. Yet it is entirely unknown what the parameters of these algorithms are, how they operate, what restrictions they impose behind the scenes and how they potentially manipulate the engagement ratios of users, specifically between standard and premium users.

### Aggressive messaging
Dating platforms frequently employ pressure based messaging, including urgency notifications, visibility anxiety prompts, near-miss feedback and artificial scarcity cues. All of which are patterns that are well documented in human–computer interaction research as dark patterns. Messages, emails and popups shown to users frequently include phrases such as:
- "Someone liked you! Upgrade to find out who!" (FOMO)
- "Swipe limit reached. Swipe unlimited with premium!" (Gatekeeping)
- "Most users succeed with Premium!" (Social Proof Manipulation)

These messages are specifically designed to suggest time criticality, promise an opportunity where none actually exists and are aimed at triggering loss aversion behaviors. Most commonly, these messages also immediately link to a paywall in an effort to coax the user into a purchase.

### Artificial Scarcity
Online dating platforms often impose strict limitations on non-premium users that are specifically designed to pressure the user into purchasing their way out of these limitations. These limits come in the form of time gates, daily limits on swipes, likes and messages and more. 
These limits are arbitrarily imposed by the platform itself and serve no other purpose than to sell users a functionality that should be included from the very start. Platforms create a problem for the user, then sell them the solution.

More concerning still is that these limits find pretty much no mention in marketing material for these platforms. They are a hidden mechanic that a user stumbles upon when first using the service, immediately being greeted with a paywall.

### Opaque one time benefits
Many platforms employ "Boosts", "Roses", "Super Likes" or similar mechanisms through which users can pay additional money with the promise of better chances. 
Promises of higher visibility, "3x more matches with boost" and similar claims are regularily made by platforms without any visible backing behind them. The user is entirely unaware of the baseline value that these products offer their claimed increase over.

Additionally, platforms often employ a fixing mechanic. Where they grant users a time gated single use of these items. Which, upon use, immediately points the user at a store page or immediately gives the option to purchase additional charges.

### Systematic underrepresentation and "Whaling"
Many of the claims stated by these platforms imply that non-premium users are intentionally underrepresented in the pool of available users or ranked below premium users with the specific goal to limit engagement and heavily restrict the usefulness of the application for non-premium users.
This is particularily concerning in conjunction with the agressive messaging these platforms employ in an effort to get users to agree to paid subscriptions and single use items. Platforms do not offer fair and equal chances to all users, they intentionally restrict non-premium users to favor high spenders and coax users into purchases.

Monetization strategies for these platforms specifically encourage "Whale" behavior, implying that increased spending comes with increased success. This is particularily worrysome in the context of addiction and financial self harm for users that are vulnerable to impulse driven purchases. Platforms actively prey on the most vulnerable consumers that are most likely to develop addictions.

## Why we take issue with these mechanics
None of the mechanisms listed above are incidental side effects. They are **structural features designed and implemented to convert frustration into revenue, disproportionately affect users who are particularly susceptible to frustration driven or impulsive purchasing behavior and systematically exploit well known cognitive biases and behavioral vulnerabilities**. We believe that this is fundamentally unfair and creates an environment with similar social risk factors as gambling.

## Why we are calling for change

It is widely documented and increasingly acknowledged that online dating services employ various mechanics of user engagement that are directly aimed at maximising user frustration in an effort to upsell features they intentionally gatekeep from non-paying users. 
Unfortunately, even though pretty much everyone that has ever engaged with these platforms is aware how they function, there have been next to no moves to make these platforms safer, more transparent and less predatory towards the majority of their users.

Online dating platforms do not operate in a social vacuum. They increasingly function as **gatekeepers of social participation**, visibility and perceived desirability.
Research in sociology, psychology and digital media studies shows that prolonged social exclusion, repeated rejection without clear explanation and opaque systems of evaluation can contribute to frustration, self-doubt and alienation. 
Especially when these experiences are intensified and monetized by platform design. Users are at an increased risk of serious psychological and financial harm through the practices employed by these platforms.

When platforms deliberately manufacture scarcity, restrict visibility, and sell temporary relief from these artificial limitations, they do far more than optimize revenue at the cost of individual consumers rights and well being. They risk amplifying existing social tensions and vulnerabilities. In such environments, prolonged frustration and perceived systemic unfairness can also contribute to broader grievance formation and radicalization pipelines that have been documented in online ecosystems.

## Lessons from gambling regulation

Many of the monetization and engagement mechanisms used by online dating platforms are not new. Comparable techniques have long been documented in the gambling industry, where their social, financial and psychological risks are well researched and understood.

As a result, gambling products are subject to strict regulation precisely because they combine:
- opaque algorithms
- aggressive messaging
- artificial scarcity
- time limited opportunities
- monetization models that concentrate revenue on a small number of highly engaged users.

Research and regulatory experience have shown that these mechanisms can contribute to compulsive behavior, financial harm and social withdrawal when left unchecked. For this reason, gambling regulation focuses not only on transparency, but on **prohibiting certain design patterns outright**, regardless of user consent.

Online dating platforms employ structurally similar mechanics, such as paid visibility, artificial interaction limits and pressure based upselling, while operating entirely without comparable safeguards or consumer protection mechanisms. Therefore we believe that it is important to apply similar rules and restrictions in spaces where the same mechanics are utilised.

## What we want to change

### 1. No premium visibility
Payments must not influence reach, ranking, matching or engagement. Social interaction must not function as an auction where the highest bidder gains the most social advantages. 
Platforms must not restrict the bare minimum features of the service with gated mechanics that hide basic functionality behind a paywall.

### 2. No pressure messaging
Ban urgency pressure, fake opportunities, visibility anxiety prompts and other pressure based messaging intended to trigger impulsive purchases.

### 3. No artificial scarcity
Artificial cooldowns, swipe limits, match limits and visibility restrictions designed to upsell premium products must be prohibited.

### 4. Regulate or prohibit intransparent chance boosting
Boosts, Superlikes, Roses and similar features must either be banned or be required to disclose their real, measurable effect in a clear and understandable way.

### 5. Algorithmic minimum fairness standards
Dating platforms must treat all customers equally. Platforms must not intentionally penalize or handicap unpaid users in order to create payment pressure. Users must be able to understand how visibility, matching and interaction limitations are applied, especially where paid and unpaid users are treated differently.

Algorithms must be subject to regular audits by independent bodies.

### 6. Liability for systemic manipulation
Platforms must bear partial liability for psychological, financial or social harm where predatory monetization mechanisms are demonstrably employed.

## What Fair Dating is not

Fair Dating does not seek to ban online dating platforms.  
We seek **fair rules for digital social participation**.

If a platform can't operate profitably without manufacturing frustration or selling relief from artificial disadvantages, then the business model, not the regulation, is the problem.

A fair and sustainable online dating ecosystem **is possible**.
